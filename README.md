Simulation Code for "Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies" (Shalizi and Thomas, 2011a)

Updated and converted to Python for results testing and verfication by Andy Edinger and Larry Zhang (2022)

Authors' original R code (Shalizi and Thomas, 2011b) is included in this repo in "neutral-diffusion_original.R", "asymmetry_original.R"

The original code has issues running in R version 4.0.2, and so was updated to remove dependency on deprecated functions among other minor bug fixes. 
The updated R code is included in this repo in "neutral-diffusion_updated.R", "asymmetry_updated.R"

Finally, the updated code was converted to python and included as Jupyter notebooks "asymmetry.ipynb", "neutral-diffusion.ipynb"

Discussion of the process of updating and translating the code and replication of results will be included.
